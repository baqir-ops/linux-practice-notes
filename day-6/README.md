# Day 6 – SSH (Secure Shell) Practice

## 📌 Objective
Learn and practice SSH fundamentals used by DevOps engineers for secure remote server access.

---

## 🔹 What I Practiced

- Installed OpenSSH server and client
- Verified SSH service status
- Generated SSH key pair (ed25519)
- Configured key-based authentication
- Verified SSH listening on port 22
- Logged in to localhost using SSH
- Managed SSH service using systemctl

## ✅ Key Learnings

- SSH provides secure remote access
- SSH works on port **22**
- Key-based authentication is more secure than passwords
- SSH service is managed using `systemctl`
- Proper permissions are critical for SSH to work

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case
DevOps engineers use SSH to:
- Access cloud servers (AWS EC2)
- Deploy applications
- Manage servers securely without passwords
